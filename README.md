# bet-app

This app was imagined to allow you to make any bet you want...well almost any bet. 

It was inspired when TV show Game Of Thrones was getting close to the end and people starting bet who was going to die (yes I know a little morbid), but it was fun to realize that people was so close, having a good time discussing possibilities of the destiny for their favorites characters and also making bets! 

SO, I just started and is suppostly to be a project for me to learn and expand my knowledge from python, react and more.
